let string1 = "hello"
let string2 = " there"
var welcome = string1 + string2
/*:You can also append a String value to an existing String variable with the addition assignment operator (+=)*/
var instruction = "look over"
instruction += string2
/*:You can append a Character value to a String variable with the String typeâ€™s append() method*/
let exclamationMark: Character = "!"
welcome.append(exclamationMark)
